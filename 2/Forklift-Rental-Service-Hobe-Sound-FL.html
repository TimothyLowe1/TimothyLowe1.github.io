<p>Whether you're looking for lifted truck shocks or, specifically, shocks for a 6-inch lift, you can rest assured we'll have what you need. These forklift trucks are manoeuvrable and swift to cover ground. The company's SLP Series features three low-profile models rated at 5,000, 6,000, and 8,000 pounds lift capacity, all using a 74-horsepower Kohler engine and shuttle-type transmission with torque converter.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope. Loads are always to be carried low to the ground, and a forklift is never to be driven with empty forks higher than 5 or 6 inches off the ground.</p>
<p>Telescopic forks - hydraulic attachments that allow the operator to operate in warehouse design for "double-deep stacking", which means that two pallet shelves are placed behind each other without any aisle between them. To ensure that your pickup truck is secure to ride while off-roading after this type of modification, you need to invest in larger tires.</p>
