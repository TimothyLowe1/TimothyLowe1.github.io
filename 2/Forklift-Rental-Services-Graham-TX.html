<p>Studies have shown that there are roughly 900,000 Rough Terrain Forklifts used every day in U.S. businesses. Citizens are free to install lift kits and after-market wheels, as well as grill guards, performance shocks, and after-market bumpers. The Industrial Truck Association (ITA, ) has defined seven classes of lift trucks, or forklifts, which are defined by the type of engine, work environment, operator position and equipment characteristics. In some cases, you may be looking to expand your business or take on work that requires equipment you don't have, like a forklift.</p>

It is important to be aware of the potential hazards of order picker trucks.

Robotic technology is estimated to be used across the Class III Forklift Trucks over the forecast period. If you plan to use a rough terrain forklift in a confined space, dimensions are important.</p>
