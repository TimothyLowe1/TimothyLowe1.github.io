<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Begin your inspection facing the front of the forklift. Take a test drive of a lifted GMC truck at our GMC dealership's headquarters as soon as you can. We take pride in offering one of the largest, most up-to-date rental fleets of lift trucks including cushion tire, heavy lift, electric and pick loader lift trucks across Alabama and Northwest Florida. Since electric forklifts use a battery, there are no fuel costs; they operate a great deal more quietly than internal combustion engines and last longer than internal combustion engines because they have less moving parts.</p>

Toyota Material Handling Term Rental System delivers operating costs on an annual basis, simplifying budgeting and cost control.

<p>These trucks are required for loading and unloading the materials and carrying it from one place to another. Our team of engineers developed our EWRS-RTF series of jcb rough terrain forklift tires to be easily repaired if damaged, although we are not sure you will need to with the quality that went into our design and components. You should be able to discuss the operational parts of the rough terrain lift, the center of gravity (lift and load) and stability characteristics (pyramid).</p>
<p>This is critical because loads longer than 48‚Äù will reduce the rated lifting capacity of your rental forklift. Maintenance personnel may be lifted on the forks to reach their work.
