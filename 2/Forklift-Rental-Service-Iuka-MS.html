Rough terrain forklifts are used for areas that need the maximum amount of traction to transport inventory safely.

With no mast blocking the view ahead like on conventional forklifts, the Teletruk's unique side boom provides unrivalled forward visibility.</p>

Control pedals and control platforms stood on or engaged by the operator's feet should have non-skid surfaces.
