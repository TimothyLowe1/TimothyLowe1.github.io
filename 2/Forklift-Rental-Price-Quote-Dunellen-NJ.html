<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>Here's a quick look at a few common hazards associated with forklifts. Often a large forklift load obstructs the driver's view in one direction. Apart from this, these rental services are rendered according to the client's demands. They work better than 4-wheel forklifts where space is limited. This product range is capable of moving the heavy loads very easily and for the packing goods in warehouses, stores and factories.</p>

A reach truck provides a range of features to help you to do the job. Indoor forklifts come with cushion tires to make it easier to maneuver on smooth warehouse floors.</p>
<p>Virtually any standard sized truck can be lifted to a certain extent or another. Some pallet jack models are able to lift loads all the way up to 15,000 pounds (6,803 kg). The forklift and load must be considered a unit with a continually varying center of gravity with every movement of the load. The pallet truck is simply for moving loads from one place to another at ground level, but it has limited reach, while the lift truck is more complex and is capable of transporting and lifting a palletised load onto a higher level or for stacking loads on top of each other.</p>

<p>When you rent a rough terrain forklift, you want to make sure it has enough power to do the job. While forklifts in this class can also be used for a variety of tasks, they're generally more suited for picking up and putting away pallets of inventory.

Linde reach trucks are tailor-made for these conditions and ensure extremely efficient operation in high rack warehouses.</p>
<p>Imagine the devastation of crashing with a semi-truck - that's the kind of damage you can expect from a lifted vehicle. Teletrucks, a new type of forklift, have an extending mast that is connected to a boom instead of a straight mast, giving them a wider range of motion. All rough terrain forklifts have a backrest that keeps the load in place. Ask the seller whether the forklift for sale is in usable condition, that the forks, mast, back rest, seat, chain and tires are undamaged, and if it has been involved in any accidents.</p>
