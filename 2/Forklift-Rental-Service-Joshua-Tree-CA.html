<p>PA Industrial Equipment, Inc. We only sell the very best, and we want Long Beach, Los Angeles, and Orange County drivers to know it. Give us a call at 877-772-3022 if you have any questions or have an interest in learning more about these trucks. OSHA Section 1910.178 lists safety procedures for fork trucks, tractors, platform lift trucks, motorized hand trucks, and other specialized industrial trucks powered by electric motors or internal combustion engines.” The most important rule is that each forklift reaches the basic standards for safety.</p>
<p>Telehandlers are four-wheel drive trucks with long attachments with forks in the end for lifting pallets and other equipment. Our range of second hand order pickers make for faster, more accurate order picking. You'll also want to make sure your truck can handle the added weight of larger tires, especially if you aren't specifically doing anything to the suspension itself.</p>

With our electric reach trucks, you will enjoy a number of technical and ergonomic benefits. The following are examples of Class V powered industrial trucks.

Full Free Lift = A truck where the fork carriage travels to the top of the inner mast before the inner mast begins to rise.
