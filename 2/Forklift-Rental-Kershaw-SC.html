<h2>Lifting & Material Handling Kershaw </h2>
<p>3. 3 Acknowledgment OSHA's Office of Training and Education wishes to acknowledge the following for contributing some of the graphics used in this presentation:  Caterpillar Lift Trucks  Mason Contractors Association of America  Industrial Truck Association  State of Utah Labor Commission - Occupational Safety & Health Division  Steamship Trade Association of Baltimore  Taylor Machine Works, Inc.</p>
<p>Here's how it works: to create a lifted truck, you take a normal truck (which was developed for agricultural purposes but is now primarily used to see over minivans in traffic) and you put a "lift kit" on it. I am not an expert on lift kits, but based on my personal observation, they offer sizes like "six inches," or "eight inches," or "tall enough to provide storm shelter for a herd of Black Rhinoceros." That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>
<p>Beyond that, many workers can also be injured when (1) lift trucks are inadvertently driven off loading docks; (2) lifts fall between docks and an unsecured trailer; (3) they are struck by a lift truck; or (4) they fall while on elevated pallets and tines. While gas forklift types do not need to charge and can operate day or night as long as they have enough fuel, battery operated forklifts need to be properly charged for up to eight hours to be used at maximum capacity.</p>
