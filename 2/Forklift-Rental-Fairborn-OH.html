<h3>Patel Lifting Solutions Fairborn OH 45324</h3>
<p>When you have a pallet jack at your warehouse to help employees tackle tasks that are physically challenging, you avoid this dissatisfaction, which can affect productivity. Reach trucks are used in large warehouses that store pallets several rows high on shelving or have deep shelves that can hold multiple pallets. The increased ground clearance reduces the risk of you damaging the underbelly of your vehicle.</p>
<p>Step area is 1.5 times larger with lower step height than fellow forklifts. The hydraulic pallet truck is very rigid, rugged and can take continuous heavy punishment in abusive Indian conditions. When looking at the forks, check for cracks, bends, and distortion that might have happened to due repeated overloading or ramming of loads. At Westminster Lift Truck Services, we always recommend that with the money needed for buying a new forklift, you can buy more used forklifts to improve your workforce productivity and have the budget for minor maintenance.</p>
