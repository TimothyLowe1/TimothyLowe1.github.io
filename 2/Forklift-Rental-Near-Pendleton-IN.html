Our product range includes a wide range of manual hand pallet trucks, hydraulic hand pallet trucks, high lift pallet truck, rough terrain pallet truck, heavy duty pallet truck and rough terrain pallet trucks.

<p>Between a 45° forward tilt and a 15° rear tilt, the H Series forklift offers the most mast tilt in the industry, allowing operators to keep loads level on any terrain or slope. A lift kit gives your truck a lot of added benefits that other trucks don't have. Lifted trucks get instant attention on the streets, and if you're looking for off-road performance, the extra ground clearance in a lifted truck can mean the difference between an exciting run, and walking home.</p>
