It is the highest capacity stockpicker in the line, handling heavy palletized loads at heights up to 366 inches. You may also wish to consult with a custom truck body modifications expert for advice as to which types of vehicles will best meet your individual needs as well. This is why the aftermarket hardware can range from a minor lift kit to a comprehensive decked out vehicle.</p>

Our product range includes a wide range of manual hand pallet trucks, hydraulic hand pallet trucks, high lift pallet truck, rough terrain pallet truck, heavy duty pallet truck and rough terrain pallet trucks.

<p>The Southeast team has years of experience managing large forklift companies, owning and operating wholesale forklift companies and turning wrenches when we need to. Consider what you will be using your forklift for and what processes you want to optimise before choosing any new machinery and training employees. Like class 1 forklifts, class 2s are also battery-powered and are more optimally used within a warehouse rather than out in the shipping yard.</p>
<p>9. 9 Scope of Standard (continued) For marine terminal and longshoring industries, all powered industrial trucks are covered, no matter what specialized name they are given. Toyota's 6BWC20 is ideal for 4,000 lb loads, while Jungeinrich's EMC 110 is suited for narrow aisles. Linde forklift hire equipment is delivered ready to give the productivity boost your business needs, from the moment your operator sits at the forklift controls.</p>
<p>On certain types of trucks, the weight on the braking wheel (s) may be insufficient to attain drawbar drag values required for higher combinations of ramp and speed. But "rough terrain" isn't simply an indication of the machine's robust nature. Turret trucks or Swing-Reach® can work in aisles as narrow as 60”, and are used for placing and retrieving pallets in warehouse rack at elevated heights.</p>
