<p>I'd also like to say that I drive a truck, 2010 F-150 Platinum everyday to and from work and love trucks very dearly as I grew up driving them in Iowa. This is the most common type of forklift, used in warehouses and shipping centers all over the world.

In other cases, you may find that there are fellow lifted truck enthusiasts in the area who can provide you with additional information.</p>
