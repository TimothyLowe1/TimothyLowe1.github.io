Larger tires and wheels have much more mass that will need stronger and larger brakes in order to allow the vehicle to safely come to a complete stop. 7. 7 Powered Industrial Truck - Definition A mobile, power-propelled truck used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack or tier materials.</p>
<p>Do not alter or eliminate any forklift parts or add any forklift parts or add any accessories such as additional counterweight or lifting attachments unless approved by the manufacturer in writing.

The Class I, Class II, and Class IV have a moderated growth rate over the forecast period as end-users are largely adopting Class III and Class V Forklift Trucks for the various applications.</p>
<p>Some dealers will sell lifted trucks, but you may be more likely to find them through alternative means, like custom shops. If you've never rented before, you might be surprised at the actual forklift rental cost and how affordable it can be.
