Forklift capacities often range from 3,000 - 7,000 lbs, meaning you can load at least 1,600 lbs on your pallet with the order picker.</p>
<p>When you rent a rough terrain forklift, you want to make sure it has enough power to do the job. While forklifts in this class can also be used for a variety of tasks, they're generally more suited for picking up and putting away pallets of inventory. On a powered pallet truck, however, the lifting of the load, and truck movement, is powered by the electric motor within the machine.</p>

The higher ground clearance will help your truck handle different types of road conditions.
