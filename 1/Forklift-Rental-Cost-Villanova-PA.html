<p>With high ground clearance and durable super-elastic wheels, these forklifts are ideal for working in indoor and outdoor environments. Rough terrain forklifts have the build and rugged construction to handle tough outdoor work.

<p>Here's how it works: to create a lifted truck, you take a normal truck (which was developed for agricultural purposes but is now primarily used to see over minivans in traffic) and you put a "lift kit" on it. I am not an expert on lift kits, but based on my personal observation, they offer sizes like "six inches," or "eight inches," or "tall enough to provide storm shelter for a herd of Black Rhinoceros." That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>

Since these machines can handle all kinds of terrain, you can shift supplies almost anywhere on a job site. There are different types available, including three-wheel models that provide better manoeuvrability, making them perfect for narrow aisles. On electric trucks the nameplate shall also show the truck weight without battery, the minimum and maximum service weights of the battery to be used, nominal voltage for which truck is arranged, and, where required, identifying number of battery required, and maximum rated ampere hour capacity for which truck is equipped.</p>
