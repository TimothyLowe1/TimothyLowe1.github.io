The 2C5000 became the primary model in 2010 and had maintained its status as one of the premier forklift models ever since.</p>
<p>Here's how it works: to create a lifted truck, you take a normal truck (which was developed for agricultural purposes but is now primarily used to see over minivans in traffic) and you put a "lift kit" on it.
