But if you drive on a sloped surface, your center of gravity could pass outside of the stability triangle and the lift could tip.</p>
<p>Here's a quick look at a few common hazards associated with forklifts. Often a large forklift load obstructs the driver's view in one direction. Apart from this, these rental services are rendered according to the client's demands. They work better than 4-wheel forklifts where space is limited.
