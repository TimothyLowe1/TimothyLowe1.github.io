<p>Operate powered industrial trucks to load and unload materials and deliveries and move them to and from storage areas, machines and loading docks, into railroad cars or trucks or storage facilities. The two forks on the front of the truck slide underneath palletised loads, to lift and transport safely. Because rough terrain vertical mast forklifts are larger and made to handle heavier loads than vertical mast counterbalanced forklifts (classes 1, 4 and 5), they require more space to operate as well as a sturdy surface that offers substantial support.

These prongs (forks) can be raised and lowered for loading, transporting, and unloading goods, particularly goods stacked on wooden pallets.

<p>Great customer service, I highly recommend the team at Damoli Forklifts. Lift Capacity: 2000 lbs.

We asked the experts and were referred to the Cal OSHA General Industry Safety Order 3656 for Order Pickers and Stocker Pickers for the answers. Rough Terrain lift trucks, which are Class 7 forklifts, require separate operator training.</p>
