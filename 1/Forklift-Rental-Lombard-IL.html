You will also need to know what the required turning radius is, and also, the minimum aisle width the lift truck will be working in.

<p>We carry new and used forklifts in every major make and model. Our Fork Lift Rental fleet is regularly updated with New Rental Equipment and maintained according to manufacturer's specifications. There are plenty of lift kits available in the market that differ in terms of how much they can raise your pickup. Three-wheel forklift trucks also have models where the operator can either sit down or just stand while operating the truck.</p>
<p>Side Loader popularity has been declining due to the more advanced multi-directional forklift that has taken its place as the king of long load handling. We've got forklifts reserved and maintained for rental customers, with everything from forklift hand pallet trucks, powered pallet truck forklifts and stacking forklifts through to 12 tonne forklifts and specialised very narrow aisle equipment.</p>
<p>These trucks are designed to lift the operator to retrieve items. Almost identical to the 6,000 lb. 4-wheel, the 6,500 lb. truck has a slightly heavier counterweight. If other tests of tests for trucks over 20,000 lb rated capacity are required, the details should be agreed upon between the interested parties.
