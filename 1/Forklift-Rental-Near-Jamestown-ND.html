Forklifts built in countries like Iran or Russia will typically have no emission control systems.</p>
<p>The Teletruk offers typical savings of up to 30% on operating costs compared to a masted forklift truck. No matter what size or capacity you need, you can find a rough terrain forklift for the job. Models through 16,000 pounds lift capacity use a standard 100-horsepower engine; the next two larger models use a 142-horsepower engine; and the largest model, the LK30P44, has a 225-horsepower engine.</p>
<p>At the time, Vincent Halma, president and CEO of KION North America, said the rate at which we're releasing new products and services is truly unprecedented.” KION also recently announced plans to expand its South Carolina facility capacity to 12,000 lift trucks a year by 2020, up from 3,000 in 2015.
