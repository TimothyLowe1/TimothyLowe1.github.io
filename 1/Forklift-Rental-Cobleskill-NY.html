When it's done right, you can expect a lifted Jeep to have better pulling power, a greater capacity to off-road because of its increased clearance, and the ability to use a much larger set of off-road tires.</p>

Many manufacturers opt for watertight wheel bearings, a hydraulic elevator or a built-in pump to ensure their rough terrain pallet jacks are easy and comfortable to use, even in the harshest conditions.</p>
<p>If you're looking specifically for Toyota forklifts, this is where you need to look. MacAllister Rentals can meet many of your industrial forklift needs. All of Hyster's leading mid and high level order pickers can be designed and manufactured with fully enclosed platforms to ensure the maximum safety for your operators. An electric reach stacker's full-function control handle ensures safe and productive operations.</p>
<p>In trucks where the operator is seated, a vertical clearance of at least 39 inches should be maintained from the point of maximum depression of the seat under the operator to the underside of the section of the guard under which the operator's head moves during normal operation. Trucks with suspension lifts tend to handle quite a bit different than factory models, not only due to the higher center of gravity but also because of the changes to the suspension.</p>
