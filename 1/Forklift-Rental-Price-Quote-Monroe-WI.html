The side-shift is a key forklift feature that will facilitate you to move any load left or right without needing to move the truck, facilitating to place loads more accurately. The first step toward buying the pre-designed lifted truck for you is to determine exactly what it is you're looking for in a vehicle of this type.</p>
<p>If the operator must frequently enter and exit the forklift to access product, build pallets, etc. Ask what kind of lift it is, who installed it and if there have been any problems with it. Most lifted trucks are bought used so bring along a flash light and inspect the truck for crusted mud in the vehicle's nooks and crannies. Stand-up forklifts (also known as stand-on and electric riders) are designed for applications where the operator must get on and off the lift truck frequently.</p>
<p>Sit-down forklifts are also more accessible to a wider pool of forklift operators for that reason.
