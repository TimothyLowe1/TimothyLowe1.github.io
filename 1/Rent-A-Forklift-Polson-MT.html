The counterbalance forklift is a popular lift that features forks in the front and a weight in the back of the vehicle to counterbalance the weight of the load. Popular brands of standup forklifts include Yale, Crown, Baker, Hyster, and Raymond, which range in price from as little as $5,000 used to as much as $35,000 for a fully equipped new machine. Counterbalanced forklifts carry their loads in front of their support point.</p>

Capable of handling heavy loads on all terrain types, Access Hire Australia's range of rough terrain forklifts are highly versatile machines.

<h2>High Quality Industrial Electric Lifters Polson </h2>
<p>Rough terrain forklifts, also known as all-terrain forklifts, are designed to work in construction sites and other areas without improved surfaces (soft ground, muddy ground, hills, ditches, etc.). The most significant difference between a standard industrial forklift (such as a Toyota) and a rough terrain forklift are the tires and ground clearance.</p>
<p>Powered industrial trucks can either be ridden by the operator or controlled by a walking operator. Generally, the smallest capacity cushion available, the 3,000 lb. is a light-duty truck ideal for warehouses and production lines. A lifted truck has its suspension raised and may have its engine modified to be louder, creating a true white trash experience. Constructed with either internal combustion engines or electric motors, reach trucks come in three main types: straddle reach trucks, standup reach trucks or double deep reach trucks.</p>
<p>Lifting your trucks suspension does not directly cause more stress on your wheels or tires. We offer long-term forklift rentals in California, Arizona, Washington, Oregon, and Nevada for fast delivery. Using the wrong lift can hinder productivity and also cause workplace accidents, so please contact our equipment specialist with any questions about forklifts and their applications.</p>
