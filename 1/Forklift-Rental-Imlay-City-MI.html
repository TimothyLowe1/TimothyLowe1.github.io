<h2>Lifting And Material Handling Imlay City </h2>
<p>Class VII - Rough terrain forklift is a generic term used to describe forklifts typically intended for use on unimproved natural terrain and disturbed terrain construction sites. Also, 4,000 lb. trucks use a heavier battery to counteract the heavier load on the forks. The order selector operators ride up and down with the load and must be secured to the truck using a belt and tether system.</p>
<p>If working spaces are tight and pedestrians or other trucks may cross your path, the braking system of a pallet truck must function perfectly. We carry a variety of pallet jacks, narrow aisle lift trucks, order pickers, and other cushion tire forklifts. We sell many of the leading brands of forklifts and other material handling equipment including Linde. Check your equipment before your shift because your fork lift is your responsibility, wear the proper gear, good footwear and a hard hat and enter and exit the forklift carefully.</p>
<p>Any time the forklift's center of gravity moves outside the stability triangle, the lift will tip over. Like the pallets themselves, pallet jacks have become a lot more standardized in North America as of late. Southeast Forklifts specializes in high quality, thoroughly inspected and reconditioned equipment you can trust. From the moment you first step into the reception area, decorated with handmade up-cycled furniture built from old pallets to the large warehouse space where the forklifts, order pickers, boom, and scissor lifts all operate, we have made a huge effort for the whole place to be a positive, professional, clean, modern and friendly environment.</p>
