<p>At building sites, they are used to offload bricks on all kinds of rough terrain whether dry or wet. A suspension lift is a modification to a vehicle to raise the ride height It is done for the purpose of improving the off road performance of SUVs or trucks and other off-road vehicles , or for cosmetic purposes. This type of forklift cannot be used for indoor applications.</p>
<p>Five new forklift models - with load capacities from 1.4 - 2.5 tons - deliver class-leading performance, and lift heights up to 13 metres.

This is because the forks are mounted to the side of the truck and can pick up wide or long loads that would be awkward or inaccessible with a straight forward forklift.</p>
