<p>They generally have a more limited range of types of rental equipment. The Forklift Trucks Market in Asia Pacific is likely to witness the highest growth in the coming years. Once this itemized list of goods (for example, a grocery order for a local store) is collected - usually on a motorized pallet jack - the order picker gets the pallet(s) ready for loading onto a truck.</p>
<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you. Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
